**Project Title**
Passport.js OAuth Authentication with React UI

**Description**
This project demonstrates how to implement OAuth authentication using Passport.js with popular providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub, along with a React user interface (UI).

The application allows users to authenticate using their Google, Facebook, or GitHub accounts, leveraging the respective OAuth APIs. Once authenticated, users can access protected routes and perform various actions based on their authorization level.

The implementation uses the following technologies:

**Passport.js**: A popular authentication middleware for Node.js that simplifies OAuth authentication and provides a consistent interface for different providers.
**React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used here to create the client-side UI for the application.
**Express**: A minimal web application framework for Node.js, used to handle server-side logic and routes.
**OAuth**: An open standard for authentication that allows users to authorize third-party applications to access their data from the providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub) without sharing their credentials.

The project's main features include:

* Support for Google, Facebook, and GitHub authentication providers.
* User registration and profile creation based on OAuth data.
* Protected routes that require user authentication.
* Authorization checks to restrict access to specific resources or actions.
* Seamless integration of OAuth flows with Passport.js.

The Final product is still under development and Soon I will deploy the final application.

HAPPY CODING üòÅ
